# Week5-ProjectHttp-Yassien-Sumithra

Task: Build an app that queries at least two APIs and uses the results to update the DOM. 

#### User Stories

As a user, I want to:

- [ ] See an interesting mashup of different data. (Our mashup is of crime and postcodes) 
- [ ] Input information to change the displayed result 
- [ ] View the app on all of my devices 


#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Query at least two APIs using fetch
- [ ] Dynamic content generated with JS
- [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
   



## Crime and Location

### User journey

- The user inputs a postcode
- That prompts a map to pop up
- The map shows the crime rate within a particular radius of that postcode
- The user can click to see a more detailed breakdown of which types of crimes
- The user can filter so only certain crimes count
