- [ ] View the app on all of my devices [#3][i3]


#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Query at least two APIs using fetch
- [ ] Dynamic content generated with JS
- [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme

## Crime and Location

### User journey

- The user inputs a postcode
- That prompts a map to pop up
- The map shows the crime rate within a particular radius of that postcode
- The user can click to see a more detailed breakdown of which types of crimes
- The user can filter so only certain crimes count
